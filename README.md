### Blocktrail curl-only SDK

This is a minimal binding to the Blocktrail API for PHP.
It is **not** supported, intended to be complete, or even, 
act as expected. It's intended for use in the Bitwasp libraries 
as development dependency (since it is dependency free). 

It is not to build an application with, that's what the official
bindings are for.
